# Recommendation System

In this repository you will find the python code to create a collaborative recommendation system using the databases provided in https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020 . A sample of the rating matrix used will be provided here.

The code begins by analizing the data and creating a sample and then a series of pipelines to create the system. It uses both cosine and euclidean distances to calculate the users distance. It returns the top 10 anime recommendation after being given a dictonary with animes and ratings from 1 to 10.
